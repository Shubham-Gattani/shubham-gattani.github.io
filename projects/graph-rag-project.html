    <section class="mb-5">
      <h3>Problem & Context</h3>
      <p>
        Traditional vector-based RAG systems work well for simple lookups but struggle with complex, multi-hop neuroscience queries.
        They often rely on limited context, single-source retrieval, and lack clear traceability to original research papers.
        This makes it difficult to generate reliable, evidence-backed answers in a domain where accuracy and citations are critical.

    <!-- ================= Your Role ================= -->
    <section class="mb-5">
      <h3>My Role & Scope</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Independently designed and built the complete data pipeline for a Graph-based RAG system</li>
        <li>Scraped and structured neuroscience research papers from PMC in a paragraph-level hierarchy</li>
        <li>Designed prompt-based pipelines using LLaMA-70B for claims, species, entity, and relationship extraction</li>
        <li>Constructed and populated a Neo4j knowledge graph with entity and paragraph nodes</li>
        <li>Enabled graph-based retrieval with explicit provenance and paragraph-level citations</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- ================= Architecture / Approach ================= -->
    <section class="mb-5">
      <h3>Architecture & Approach</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Scraped neuroscience research papers (XML) from PMC and organized them into a structured filesystem</li>
        <li>Extracted claims, contributions, and experimental species using prompt-engineered LLaMA-70B workflows</li>
        <li>Performed domain-specific NER using LexiFuzz with NIF ontology at paragraph level</li>
        <li>Extracted semantic relationships between entity pairs using LLMs and stored them as structured JSON</li>
        <li>Injected entities and relationships into Neo4j, linking entities to exact source paragraphs</li>
        <li>Answered user queries by identifying relevant entities, executing Cypher queries, and grounding responses in original text</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- ================= Key Technical Decisions ================= -->
    <section class="mb-5">
      <h3>Key Technical Decisions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Modeled the graph with <strong>two node types</strong> (Entity and Paragraph) to preserve fine-grained provenance and traceability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Used <strong>RELATED_TO</strong> relationships between entities and <strong>DESCRIBES</strong> edges to link entities to source paragraphs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Chose paragraph-level processing instead of document-level extraction to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combined ontology-based NER with fuzzy matching to balance precision and recall in a specialized domain.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- ================= Results & Impact ================= -->
    <section class="mb-5">
      <h3>Results & Impact</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Enabled multi-hop, graph-based reasoning for complex neuroscience queries</li>
        <li>Generated answers with explicit paragraph-level evidence and PMC references</li>
        <li>Outperformed bio-specific LLMs (Bio-Mistral, SciLitLLM) in depth, rigor, and citation quality</li>
        <li>Achieved significantly higher evaluation scores in zero-shot comparisons against GPT-4o</li>
      </ul>
